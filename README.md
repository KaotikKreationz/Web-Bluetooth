# Web-Bluetooth-Api

(https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/web-bluetooth/)

Simple web page that will pair with our phone and give us basic details such as the battery percentage, name of the device, and basic information provided by the device manufacturer.

Remember, not all browsers support this API, and you wonâ€™t be able to test this with every phone. Some phones might not allow fetching device information. In this tutorial, I will be using an Apple iPhone 11, which allows me to fetch my device information through Bluetooth on my browser without any problems.
